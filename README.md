Predict stock market of Amazon using linear regression

Abstract :
           In a financially volatile market, as the stock market, it is important to have a very precise prediction of a future trend. Because of the financial crisis and scoring profits, it is mandatory to have a secure prediction of the values of the stocks. Predicting a non-linear signal requires advanced algorithms of machine learning. The literature contains studies with different machine learning algorithms such as ANN (artificial neural networks) with different feature selection. The results of this study will show that the algorithm of classification SVM (Support Vector Machines) with the help of feature selection PCA (Principal component analysis) will have the success of making a profit.
           
Problem statement :
            Stock exchanges are financial institutions which allow transferability of different goods (monetary values, actions, precious metals) between stock broker components. With a turnover of trading around thousands of billions dollars, this gets people's eager attention of making a profit. Goods are traded on the market, following their subsequent value to determine if the transaction has generated profit or not. In general the value of a stock is given by its entry on the stock exchange and the volume of its transactions. The more a share is transacted, the more it is valuable, and conversely, if a share is put into transaction in a low volume, it is not so important for some traders and by default its value decreases. This anticipation of the market can generate profits or losses, depending on the power to predict future values. Therefore the problem becomes: for a given stock market history, determine the moment of buying/entry or selling/exit the good for generating profit. An aspect that has attracted researchers is predicting the values of the goods. 

Result :
          Thus the stock market of Amazon was predicted using Linear Regression. And also the output was saved. (output_12_0 showed the predicted stock market price of Amazon in the future. It showed the stock price upto 9th month of 2018 also.)
